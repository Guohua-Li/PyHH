# PyHH-Neuron-Simulation-Tool
A Python library for patch clampers
PyHH is a small library based on Hodgkin-Huxley formulation for voltage-gated ion channels and the Markov model for ligand-gated ion channels. It is written in Python for patch clamper, so PyHH uses terms which are easily understood by those with patch clamp experience. Knowledge about Python programs is helpful, but not required. PyHH is small, but can be used for building very complicated neuron models. It is useful for patch clamper to better understand some important concepts in electrophysiology.
