PyHH is a small library based on Hodgkin-Huxley formulation for voltage-gated ion channels and the Markov model for ligand-gated ion channels. It is written in Python for patch clamper, and uses terms which are easily understood by those with patch clamp experience. Knowledge about Python programing is helpful, but not required. PyHH is small, but can be used for building very complicated neuron models. It is useful for patch clamper to better understand some important concepts in electrophysiology. 

I suppose you are not programmers, but patch clampers just as I used to be. The tutorial materials help you start with PyHH. PyHH contains the core file named pyhh.py, and two files for advanced usage: voltage-gated.py and calcium-activated.py. Just drop these file in any folder where you want to use PyHH. Also drop the example scripts in the same folder. I will update the the example scripts regularly.
